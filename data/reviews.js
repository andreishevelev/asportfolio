    review: "We hired Andrew as our sound engineer for a recent event, and he exceeded all expectations. Not only did he expertly set up and operate our audio equipment, ensuring flawless sound quality, but he also went above and beyond during strike — methodically packing cables, securing delicate gear, and helping ensure everything was organized for transport and future use. His professionalism, attention to detail, and dedication made the event a success. We highly recommend Andrew for all your sound reinforcement needs and look forward to working with him again in the future!",
